### XEON: A matriX-based dispErsion relatiON solver for plasma physics
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/215848704.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/215848704)

XEON is a collection of matrix-based plasma dispersion relation (DR) solvers written in Python 3. The algorithms are extended from [[1]] and [[2]] pioneered by Dr. Huasheng Xie.

For a quick taste of the flavor, following is a snippet to compute the DR for the Bump-on-tail instability:
```python
species = np.array([
    # parameters of each species
    # q, m, n,   v,     p
    [-1, 1, 0.9, 0,     0.9],  # background electron
    [-1, 1, 0.1, 7.071, 0.1],  # beam electron
])
params = dict(epsilon0=1)  # other parameters
ks = np.linspace(0.0001, 0.6, 50)  # an array of wavenumbers
# for each wavenumber, compute the complex frequencies
ws = xeon.vlasov.k2w_es1d(ks, species, params)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 5), sharex=True)
xeon.common.plot_dr(ks, ws, ax0=axs[0], ax1=axs[1])
```
For more examples, refer to [`demos`](demos).

#### How does xeon work?
- The linearized fluid or Vlasov equations are transformed into a matrix form, and complex frequencies `[w1, w2, w3, ...]` are computed as eigenvalues of this coefficient matrix for each wavenumber `k`.
- In this matrix-based method, no initial guess is necessary, and all solutions, including eigenvectors, are captured.
- If you prefer Matlab over Python, please consider the original implementation, [BO](https://github.com/hsxie/pdrk), by Dr. Huasheng Xie.

#### What is the license?
- Xeon is under MIT licence with maximum freedom to use.
- Please cite the code at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3497597 or

#### Does xeon rely on other softwares to work?  
- Modern [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org) are required for computation.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is required for using the visualization tool.

#### How do I load xeon?
Currently, the package is in development stage and is provided only as is. One option to use the package is to make Python aware of its path:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("/path/to/xeon/")
import xeon
```
PyPI and Anaconda distributions will be used starting release 0.2.0.

#### What are the folders/files for?
- [`fluid`](fluid): Multifluid dispersion relation solver supporting anisotropic pressure. `ES1D`, `ES3D`, and `EM3D` version are implemented.
- [`vlasov`](vlasov): Vlasov dispersion relation solver for a warm plasma. `ES1D` and `ES3D` versions are implemented.
- [`common`](common): Coefficient generator, convenience tools for visulization, etc.
- [`demos`](demos): Demos compiled as markdown documents. This folder is being consolidated.

#### How do I use xeon?
- For the complete API, see https://liangwang0734.github.io/xeon/
- For examples with both computation and visualization, refer to [`demos`](demos), which will be consolidated.
